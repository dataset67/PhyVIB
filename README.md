| **Human Anomalies**    | **Abnormal Limb Number**                       | A deviation from the typical number of limbs or extremities in the human body, referring to either an excess or a deficiency in the number of limbs.                                                  | 1000                                  |
|                        | **Abnormal Body Shape/Structure**              | An irregularity in the development, shape, size, movement, or function of limbs or other body parts that deviates from normal anatomical structures and physiological principles.                | 1000                                  |
|                        | **Dual Deviation**                             | A case in which a human figure simultaneously exhibits both an abnormal number of limbs and irregularities in limb shape, structure, or function.                                                  | 1000                                  |
| **Perspective Distortion** |                                          | A visual misrepresentation in which the spatial relationships and scales of objects do not correspond to their actual distances. This includes violations of the principle that near objects appear larger and distant objects appear smaller, disproportionate scaling, and parallel lines failing to converge at a single vanishing point. | 1000                                  |
| **Boundary Anomalies** |                                                | A condition characterized by the lack of clear boundaries or delineation between objects in an image, making it difficult to determine the precise extent and size of each object.                    | 1000                                  |
| **Optical Anomalies**  | **Abnormal Rectilinear Propagation of Light**  | A deviation from the physical principle of rectilinear light propagation, manifested by missing shadows, incorrect shadow shapes or directions, excessive shadows, inconsistencies between shadows and objects, or the presence of multiple shadows. | 1000                                  |
|                        | **Abnormal Refraction of Light**               | A violation of the law of refraction, where light bends at incorrect angles, follows improper paths, or causes distortions in the appearance of objects.                                            | 1000                                  |
| **Motion Anomalies**   |                                                | A phenomenon in which the motion of an object in an image contradicts real-world physical principles—such as gravity, friction, and inertia—resulting in movements that do not follow expected physical trajectories or behaviors. | 1000                                  |
