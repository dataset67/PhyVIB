| **Human Anomalies**           | **Abnormal Limb Number**                        | A deviation from the typical number of limbs or extremities in the human body. It involves either an excess or deficiency in the number of limbs.                     | 1000                                  |
|                              | **Abnormal Body Shape/Structure**               | Abnormal body Shape/Structure refers to irregularities in the development, shape, size, movement, or function of limbs or other body parts that deviate from normal anatomical structure and physiological principles. | 1000                                  |
|                              | **Dual Deviation**                              | Cases where a human figure simultaneously exhibits both an abnormal number of limbs (either excessive or missing) and irregularities in limb shape, structure, or function. | 1000                                  |
| **Perspective Distortion**    |                                             | A visual misrepresentation where the spatial relationships and scale of objects do not correspond to their actual distances, resulting in deviations from standard perspective principles. This includes violations of the "near objects appear larger, distant objects appear smaller" rule, disproportionate scaling, and parallel lines not converging at a single vanishing point.                                                                                                                                                       | 1000                                  |
| **Boundary Anomalies**        |                                           |            The lack of clear boundaries or delineation between objects in an image, making it difficult to distinguish the extent and size of each object.                                                                                                                                                           | 1000                                  |
| **Optical Anomalies**         | **Abnormal Rectilinear Propagation of Light**    | The light or shadow distribution in an image violates the physical principle of rectilinear propagation, manifested as missing shadows, incorrect shadow shapes or directions, excessive shadows, inconsistency between shadows and objects, or multiple shadows. | 1000                                  |
|                              | **Abnormal Refraction of Light**                | A violation of the refraction law occurs when light refracts incorrectly, such as with incorrect refraction angles, improper refraction paths, or distortion of objects due to refraction. | 1000                                  |
| **Motion Anomalies**          |                                               |         A situation where the motion direction of an object in an image contradicts real-world physical principles, such as gravity, friction, and inertia. These anomalies typically manifest as movements that do not follow expected physical trajectories or behaviors.                                                                                                                                                             | 1000                                  |
