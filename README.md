# PhyVIB: Physics-commonsense Violation Image Benchmark

Our purposed PhyVIB has totally 16000 images with 8 categories. We provide the code and data examples here, the whole dataset will be released after the paper is accepted.

The following table illustrates the definition and image numbers of each anomaly category.

| **Domains**         | **Categories**                             | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Number of Images (to be uploaded)** |

| **Human Anomalies**    | **Abnormal Limb/Finger Number**                       | A deviation from the typical number of limbs or fingers in the human body                                                  | 1000                                  |
|                        | **Abnormal Body Shape/Structure**              | Human shape, size, or function of limbs and other body parts deviate from normal anatomical structures and physiological principles.                | 1000                                  |
|                        | **Dual Deviation**                             | Human figures exhibit both abnormal limb/finger number and body shape/structure                                                  | 1000                                  |
| **Perspective** |                  **Distorted Perspective**                       | The spatial relationships and scales of objects do not correspond to their actual distances | 1000                                  |
| **Boundary** |                     **Unclear Boundary**                           | The lack of clear boundaries or delineation between objects                    | 1000                                  |
| **Optical**  | **Abnormal Rectilinear Propagation of Light**  | A deviation from the rectilinear light propagation principle, manifested by excessive/missing shadows, inconsistencies between shadows and objects | 1000                                  |
|                        | **Abnormal Refraction of Light**               | A violation of the law of refraction, where light follows improper paths, or causes distortions in the appearance of objects                                            | 1000                                  |
| **Motion**   |                **Anomalous Motion**                                | The objectâ€™s motion contradicts physical principles, resulting in unexpected movements | 1000                                  |
