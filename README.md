| **Human Anomalies**           | **Abnormal Limb Number**                        | A deviation from the typical number of limbs or extremities in the human body. It involves either an excess or deficiency in the number of limbs.                     | 1000                                  |
|                              | **Abnormal Body Shape/Structure**               | Abnormal body Shape/Structure refers to irregularities in the development, shape, size, movement, or function of limbs or other body parts that deviate from normal anatomical structure and physiological principles. | 1000                                  |
|                              | **Dual Deviation**                              | Severe Limb Anomalies refer to cases where a human figure simultaneously exhibits both an abnormal number of limbs (either excessive or missing) and irregularities in limb shape, structure, or function. | 1000                                  |
| **Perspective Distortion**    |                                                  | to be updated                                                                                                                                                         | 1000                                  |
| **Boundary Anomalies**        |                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                      | 1000                                  |
| **Optical Anomalies**         | **Abnormal Rectilinear Propagation of Light**    | The light or shadow distribution in an image violates the physical principle of rectilinear propagation, manifested as missing shadows, incorrect shadow shapes or directions, excessive shadows, inconsistency between shadows and objects, or multiple shadows. | 1000                                  |
|                              | **Abnormal Refraction of Light**                | A violation of the refraction law occurs when light refracts incorrectly, such as with incorrect refraction angles, improper refraction paths, or distortion of objects due to refraction. | 1000                                  |
| **Motion Anomalies**          |                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                      | 1000                                  |
